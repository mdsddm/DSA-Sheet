/*  3218. Minimum Cost for Cutting Cake I
There is an m x n cake that needs to be cut into 1 x 1 pieces.
You are given integers m, n, and two arrays:
horizontalCut of size m - 1, where horizontalCut[i] represents the cost to cut along the horizontal line i.
verticalCut of size n - 1, where verticalCut[j] represents the cost to cut along the vertical line j.
In one operation, you can choose any piece of cake that is not yet a 1 x 1 square and perform one of the following cuts:
Cut along a horizontal line i at a cost of horizontalCut[i].
Cut along a vertical line j at a cost of verticalCut[j].
After the cut, the piece of cake is divided into two distinct pieces.
The cost of a cut depends only on the initial cost of the line and does not change.
Return the minimum total cost to cut the entire cake into 1 x 1 pieces.

Example 1:
Input: m = 3, n = 2, horizontalCut = [1,3], verticalCut = [5]
Output: 13
Explanation:
Perform a cut on the vertical line 0 with cost 5, current total cost is 5.
Perform a cut on the horizontal line 0 on 3 x 1 subgrid with cost 1.
Perform a cut on the horizontal line 0 on 3 x 1 subgrid with cost 1.
Perform a cut on the horizontal line 1 on 2 x 1 subgrid with cost 3.
Perform a cut on the horizontal line 1 on 2 x 1 subgrid with cost 3.
The total cost is 5 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 13.

Example 2:
Input: m = 2, n = 2, horizontalCut = [7], verticalCut = [4]
Output: 15
Explanation:
Perform a cut on the horizontal line 0 with cost 7.
Perform a cut on the vertical line 0 on 1 x 2 subgrid with cost 4.
Perform a cut on the vertical line 0 on 1 x 2 subgrid with cost 4.
The total cost is 7 + 4 + 4 = 15.

Constraints:
1 <= m, n <= 20
horizontalCut.length == m - 1
verticalCut.length == n - 1
1 <= horizontalCut[i], verticalCut[i] <= 103
